"""Instructions:

Use the provided Cat class to create three cat objects. Then, create a function to find the oldest cat and print its details.



Step 1: Create Cat Objects

Use the Cat class to create three cat objects with different names and ages.


Step 2: Create a Function to Find the Oldest Cat

Create a function that takes the three cat objects as input.
Inside the function, compare the ages of the cats to find the oldest one.
Return the oldest cat object.


Step 3: Print the Oldest Cat‚Äôs Details

Call the function to get the oldest cat.
Print a formatted string: ‚ÄúThe oldest cat is <cat_name>, and is <cat_age> years old.‚Äù
Replace <cat_name> and <cat_age> with the oldest cat‚Äôs name and age.

"""üåü Exercise 2 : Dogs

Goal: Create a Dog class, instantiate objects, call methods, and compare dog sizes.



Key Python Topics:

Classes and objects
Object instantiation
Methods
Attributes
Conditional statements (if)


Instructions:

Create a Dog class with methods for barking and jumping. Instantiate dog objects, call their methods, and compare their sizes.



Step 1: Create the Dog Class

Create a class called Dog.
In the __init__ method, take name and height as parameters and create corresponding attributes.
Create a bark() method that prints ‚Äú goes woof!‚Äù.
Create a jump() method that prints ‚Äú jumps cm high!‚Äù, where x is height * 2.


Step 2: Create Dog Objects

Create davids_dog and sarahs_dog objects with their respective names and heights.


Step 3: Print Dog Details and Call Methods

Print the name and height of each dog.
Call the bark() and jump() methods for each dog.

Goal: Create a Song class to represent song lyrics and print them.



Key Python Topics:

Classes and objects
Object instantiation
Methods
Lists


Instructions:

Create a Song class with a method to print song lyrics line by line.



Step 1: Create the Song Class

Create a class called Song.
In the __init__ method, take lyrics (a list) as a parameter and create a corresponding attribute.
Create a sing_me_a_song() method that prints each element of the lyrics list on a new line.


Example:

"""üåü Exercise 4 : Afternoon At The Zoo

Goal:

Create a Zoo class to manage animals. The class should allow adding animals, displaying them, selling them, and organizing them into alphabetical groups.



Key Python Topics:

Classes and objects
Object instantiation
Methods
Lists
Dictionaries (for grouping)
String manipulation


Instructions

Step 1: Define The Zoo Class

1. Create a class called Zoo.

2. Implement the __init__() method:

It takes a string parameter zoo_name, representing the name of the zoo.
Initialize an empty list called animals to keep track of animal names.
3. Add a method add_animal(new_animal):

This method adds a new animal to the animals list.
Do not add the animal if it is already in the list.
4. Add a method get_animals():

This method prints all animals currently in the zoo.
5. Add a method sell_animal(animal_sold):

This method checks if a specified animal exists on the animals list and if so, remove from it.
6. Add a method sort_animals():

This method sorts the animals alphabetically.
It also groups them by the first letter of their name.
The result should be a dictionary where:
Each key is a letter.
Each value is a list of animals that start with that letter.
Example output:

{
   'B': ['Baboon', 'Bear'],
   'C': ['Cat', 'Cougar'],
   'G': ['Giraffe'],
   'L': ['Lion'],
   'Z': ['Zebra']
}
7. Add a method get_groups():

This method prints the dict_animals animals as created by sort_animals().
Example output:

B: ['Baboon', 'Bear']
C: ['Cat', 'Cougar']
G: ['Giraffe']
...
